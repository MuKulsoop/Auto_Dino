I have written this program to practice the Pythongui module. <br>
This program still have a bug in the laptops having dark theme in there as I also have dark theme. The dinosaur did not duck when facing bird. Didn't fixes this bug yet.<br>
If anyone want to try to fix he can do by playing the dino game on "chrome://dino" .<br>
Also speed of jumping of the dinosaur still not great so it gets out when the speed gets fast. <br>
Will fixes these bugs later.
